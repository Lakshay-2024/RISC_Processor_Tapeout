# Digital_VLSI_RISC_Tapeout


This repository contains all the work I have done in the **Physical Design** workshop using **Openalne and Google skywater 130nm pdk** offered by **VSD VLSI** starting from December 19/2025 - December 28/2025.

This repository documents my **daywise progress** with tasks and assignments inside each day's directory.
