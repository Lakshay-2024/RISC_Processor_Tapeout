# Pre-layout timing analysis and importance of good clock tree 

## Theory

### Implementation

* Section 4 tasks:-
1. Fix up small DRC errors and verify the design is ready to be inserted into our flow.
2. Save the finalized layout with custom name and open it.
3. Generate lef from the layout.
4. Copy the newly generated lef and associated required lib files to 'picorv32a' design 'src' directory.
5. Edit 'config.tcl' to change lib file and add the new extra lef into the openlane flow.
6. Run openlane flow synthesis with newly inserted custom inverter cell.
7. Remove/reduce the newly introduced violations with the introduction of custom inverter cell by modifying design parameters.
8. Once synthesis has accepted our custom inverter we can now run floorplan and placement and verify the cell is accepted in PnR flow.
9. Do Post-Synthesis timing analysis with OpenSTA tool.
10. Make timing ECO fixes to remove all violations.
11. Replace the old netlist with the new netlist generated after timing ECO fix and implement the floorplan, placement and cts.
12. Post-CTS OpenROAD timing analysis.
13. Explore post-CTS OpenROAD timing analysis by removing 'sky130_fd_sc_hd__clkbuf_2' cell from clock buffer list variable 'CTS_CLK_BUFFER_LIST'.


#### 1. Fix up small DRC errors and verify the design is ready to be inserted into our flow.

Conditions to be verified before moving forward with custom designed cell layout:
* Condition 1: The input and output ports of the standard cell should lie on the intersection of the vertical and horizontal tracks.
* Condition 2: Width of the standard cell should be odd multiples of the horizontal track pitch.
* Condition 3: Height of the standard cell should be even multiples of the vertical track pitch.

# Change directory to vsdstdcelldesign
cd /home/lakshay/vsdstdcelldesign

# Command to open custom inverter layout in magic

#### 6. Run openlane flow synthesis with newly inserted custom inverter cell.

Commands to invoke the OpenLANE flow include new lef and perform synthesis 

```bash
# Change directory to openlane flow directory
cd Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane

# alias docker='docker run -it -v $(pwd):/openLANE_flow -v $PDK_ROOT:$PDK_ROOT -e PDK_ROOT=$PDK_ROOT -u $(id -u $USER):$(id -g $USER) efabless/openlane:v0.21'
# Since we have aliased the long command to 'docker' we can invoke the OpenLANE flow docker sub-system by just running this command
docker
```
```tcl
# Now that we have entered the OpenLANE flow contained docker sub-system we can invoke the OpenLANE flow in the Interactive mode using the following command
./flow.tcl -interactive

# Now that OpenLANE flow is open we have to input the required packages for proper functionality of the OpenLANE flow
package require openlane 0.9

# Now the OpenLANE flow is ready to run any design and initially we have to prep the design creating some necessary files and directories for running a specific design which in our case is 'picorv32a'
prep -design picorv32a

# Adiitional commands to include newly added lef to openlane flow
set lefs [glob $::env(DESIGN_DIR)/src/*.lef]
add_lefs -src $lefs

Commands to view and change parameters to improve timing and run synthesis

```tcl
# Now once again we have to prep design so as to update variables
prep -design picorv32a -tag 24-03_10-03 -overwrite

# Addiitional commands to include newly added lef to openlane flow merged.lef
set lefs [glob $::env(DESIGN_DIR)/src/*.lef]
add_lefs -src $lefs

# Command to display current value of variable SYNTH_STRATEGY
echo $::env(SYNTH_STRATEGY)

# Command to set new value for SYNTH_STRATEGY

# Command to display current value of variable SYNTH_SIZING
echo $::env(SYNTH_SIZING)

# Command to set new value for SYNTH_SIZING
set ::env(SYNTH_SIZING) 1

# Command to display current value of variable SYNTH_DRIVING_CELL to check whether it's the proper cell or not
echo $::env(SYNTH_DRIVING_CELL)

# Now that the design is prepped and ready, we can run synthesis using following command
run_synthesis
```

#### 8. Once synthesis has accepted our custom inverter we can now run floorplan and placement and verify the cell is accepted in PnR flow.

Now that our custom inverter is properly accepted in synthesis we can now run floorplan using following command

```tcl
# Now we can run floorplan
run_floorplan
```


Now that floorplan is done we can do placement using following command

```tcl
# Now we are ready to run placement
run_placement
```



Commands to load placement def in magic in another terminal

```bash
# Change directory to path containing generated placement def
cd /OpenLane/designs/picorv32a/runs/RUN_2025.12.26_13.02.52/results/placement/

# Command to load the placement def in magic tool

#### 9. Do Post-Synthesis timing analysis with OpenSTA tool.

Since we are having 0 wns after improved timing run we are going to do timing analysis on initial run of synthesis which has lots of violations and no parameters were added to improve timing

Commands to invoke the OpenLANE flow include new lef and perform synthesis 

```bash
# Change directory to openlane flow directory
cd Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane
make mount
```
```tcl
# Now that we have entered the OpenLANE flow contained docker sub-system we can invoke the OpenLANE flow in the Interactive mode using the following command
./flow.tcl -interactive

# Now that OpenLANE flow is open we have to input the required packages for proper functionality of the OpenLANE flow
package require openlane 0.9

# Now the OpenLANE flow is ready to run any design and initially we have to prep the design creating some necessary files and directories for running a specific design which in our case is 'picorv32a'
prep -design picorv32a

# Adiitional commands to include newly added lef to openlane flow
set lefs [glob $::env(DESIGN_DIR)/src/*.lef]
add_lefs -src $lefs

# Command to set new value for SYNTH_SIZING
set ::env(SYNTH_SIZING) 1

# Now that the design is prepped and ready, we can run synthesis using following command
run_synthesis
```



Newly created `pre_sta.conf` for STA analysis in `openlane` directory

Since more fanout is causing more delay we can add parameter to reduce fanout and do synthesis again

Commands to include new lef and perform synthesis 

```tcl
# Now the OpenLANE flow is ready to run any design and initially we have to prep the design creating some necessary files and directories for running a specific design which in our case is 'picorv32a'
prep -design picorv32a -tag 25-03_18-52 -overwrite

# Adiitional commands to include newly added lef to openlane flow
set lefs [glob $::env(DESIGN_DIR)/src/*.lef]
add_lefs -src $lefs

# Command to set new value for SYNTH_SIZING
set ::env(SYNTH_SIZING) 1

# Command to set new value for SYNTH_MAX_FANOUT
set ::env(SYNTH_MAX_FANOUT) 4

# Command to display current value of variable SYNTH_DRIVING_CELL to check whether it's the proper cell or not

Commands to verify instance `_14506_`  is replaced with `sky130_fd_sc_hd__or4_4`

```tcl
# Generating custom timing report
report_checks -from _29043_ -to _30440_ -through _14506_
```

*We started ECO fixes at wns -23.9000 and now we stand at wns -22.6173 we reduced around 1.2827 ns of violation*

#### 11. Replace the old netlist with the new netlist generated after timing ECO fix and implement the floorplan, placement and cts.

Now to insert this updated netlist to PnR flow and we can use `write_verilog` and overwrite the synthesis netlist but before that we are going to make a copy of the old old netlist

Commands to make copy of netlist

```bash
# Change from home directory to synthesis results directory
cd Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane/designs/picorv32a/runs/25-03_18-52/results/synthesis/

# List contents of the directory
ls

# Copy and rename the netlist
cp picorv32a.synthesis.v picorv32a.synthesis_old.v

# List contents of the directory
ls
```

Commands to write verilog

```tcl
# Check syntax
help write_verilog

# Overwriting current synthesis netlist
write_verilog /home/vsduser/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane/designs/picorv32a/runs/25-03_18-52/results/synthesis/picorv32a.synthesis.v

# Exit from OpenSTA since timing analysis is done
exit
```

Verified that the netlist is overwritten by checking that instance `_14506_`  is replaced with `sky130_fd_sc_hd__or4_4`

Since we confirmed that netlist is replaced and will be loaded in PnR but since we want to follow up on the earlier 0 violation design we are continuing with the clean design to further stages

Commands load the design and run necessary stages

```tcl
# Now once again we have to prep design so as to update variables
prep -design picorv32a 

# Addiitional commands to include newly added lef to openlane flow merged.lef
set lefs [glob $::env(DESIGN_DIR)/src/*.lef]
add_lefs -src $lefs

# Command to set new value for SYNTH_STRATEGY
set ::env(SYNTH_STRATEGY) "DELAY 3"

# Command to set new value for SYNTH_SIZING
set ::env(SYNTH_SIZING) 1

# Now that the design is prepped and ready, we can run synthesis using following command
run_synthesis

# Follwing commands are alltogather sourced in "run_floorplan" command
init_floorplan
place_io
tap_decap_or

# Now we are ready to run placement
run_placement

# Incase getting error
unset ::env(LIB_CTS)

# With placement done we are now ready to run CTS
run_cts
```
